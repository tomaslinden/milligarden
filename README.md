# milligarden
Milligarden is a work-in-progress project with the goal of providing a convenient way to generate CAD-drawings (in STL-format) for Square-Foot-Gardening -inspired gardening boxes from user specifications. It relies on OpenJSCAD.org for the actual rendering of the CAD-drawings and exporting of STL-files.

# Usage
Load http://openjscad.org in a browser (e.g. a recent version of Firefox) and drag either box.jscad or multibox.jscad along with Timber.js and util.js into the file-drop area in the lower left corner of OpenJSCAD.org.

# Roadmap
Initial upcoming and related project development backlog can be found over at taiga.io: https://tree.taiga.io/project/hearthstone-milligarden

# Credit
Thanks go to the developers of OpenJSCAD.org for writing a nice variant of SCAD and for providing the polished online execution environment at the project website. 

Credit also goes to Mel Bartholomew for the All New Square-Foot-Gardening book and the space-efficient gardening concept presented in it, which has heavily influenced the design of the boxes and the building and usage of the first milligarden box prototypes.

Special thanks also go to the Oulu-branch of Dodo Ry (dodo.fi) for providing a nice hosting environment and funding of the fist vertical gardening milligarden prototype!
